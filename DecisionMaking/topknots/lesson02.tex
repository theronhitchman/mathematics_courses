\section{Phase 1}
Do a bit of peer instruction/guided practice wrap up. 
Use these polleverywhere.com questions:

\begin{question}
 Which pair of diagram and symbolic description is incorrect?  ( give three options with pictures and symbols)
\end{question}

\begin{question} will the correct ones solve PHP2?
\end{question}

\begin{question} 
which diagram goes with symbol A*BB? (give two options)
\end{question}

\begin{question} 
will either of these solve PHP2?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
I have solved PHP2:  T/F
\end{question}

\section{Phase 2} 
Give time to discuss \& play. manipulatives available. work in groups of 3. Expect a solution at some point, if students haven't found one before class.

\section{Phase 3}
Ask students to find a generalization of the problem to three nails. (Note there are two reasonable generalizations. It is extra awesome if the students get both.)
