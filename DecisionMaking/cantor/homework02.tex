One way to represent numbers is with \emph{dot pictures}.
Here are some different dot pictures for the number 10:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
OOOOO\\ OOOOO
\end{array}
\qquad
\begin{array}{l} OOO\\ OOO \\ OOO \\ O\end{array}
\qquad\begin{array} {l} OOO\\ OO\\ OO\\ O\\ O\\ O\end{array}
\qquad\begin{array}{l} OOOOOOO\\ O \\ O \\ O\end{array}
\qquad\begin{array}{l} OOO\\ OOO\\ OO\\ OO\end{array}
%\qquad
%\begin{array}{l}OO\\ OO\\ OO\\ O\\ O\\ O\\ O\end{array}
\]

The definition of the term \emph{dot picture} requires exactly that there are as many dots as the given number, and each row has at least as many dots as the row immediately below it.

Let $T$ be the set of dot pictures that represent the number 10 and have exactly three rows.

Let $J$ be the set of ways to represent 10 as a sum of three positive integers.
For example, here are some elements of the set $J$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{cccc}
10 & = 5 &+ 3 &+ 2 \\
10 & = 4 &+ 3 &+ 3\\
10 & = 6 & +2 &+ 2 \\
\end{array}
\quad
\begin{array}{cccc}
10 & = 8 &+ 1 &+ 1 \\
10 & = 6 &+ 3 &+ 1\\
10 & = 7 & +2 &+ 1 \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
Notice that for this task we consider two representations as being the same if all you do is reorder the numbers.
So $10 = 5 + 3 +2$ is the same thing as $10 = 2 + 3 + 5$ and also the same thing as $10 = 2 + 5 + 3$.
Also, the representation $10 = 9 + 1 + 0$ is not an element of $J$ because $0$ is not a positive integer.

In one written page, describe a matching between the elements of $T$ and the elements of $J$.
Discuss why this means that these two sets have the same number of elements.
