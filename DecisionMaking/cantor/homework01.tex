\textbf{Written Assignment \#1}
}
\end{center}

On the first day of our unit, we considered the following two counting problems.

\begin{problem}
There is a meeting of 56 people. How many ways can one choose a team of two people from those attending the meeting?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
There is a meeting of 56 people. How many ways can one choose a team of 54 people from those attending the meeting?
\end{problem}

By now, you may know ways to solve each of these problems by counting. 
The point of this assignment is to show that \emph{only need to know how solve one of them.}

In one written page, explain how you can see that these two problems have the same number of solutions. 
Please avoid actually counting how many solutions there are to either problem.
