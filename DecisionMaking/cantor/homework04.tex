Suppose that you are given two sets $A$ and $B$.
At this point, the names are just place holders. 
These sets could be just about anything!
Well, not \emph{anything}.
You know for sure that both $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite.\\

Show that there is a matching between the elements of $A$ and the elements of $B$.
That is, describe how you know there has to be such a matching, and how you would go about sharing that matching.

Write as if describing this to a friend who is not in this class, but could be.
